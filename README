Project target is to create extended C++ AVR kernel.
Devel board: Atmega2560, Wiznet W5100, UVGAII-SGC, PS2 Keyboard
Programmed with: AVR ISP mkII
Already done:
1)Basic video driver
2)Keyboard driver
3)basic built-in shell
4)USART with PC via usb

To do for now:
0) simple Python application to communicate with PC
1) SD card driver -> WIP, it was a wiring problem
2) FS driver and implementation (FAT32,maybe ext3?)
3) Ethernet driver, server mode
4) Ethernet client mode (some kind of browser)
5) basic kernel scheduler
6) device memory extension
7) program loader (with x86 linker)
8) advanced video driver
9) Shell improvements, continue development...


...maybe rewrite to pure C?
